- `styles.css`: The CSS file that defines the styles and appearance of the application.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles user interactions and data retrieval from the GitHub API.
- `imgs/`: A directory containing the images used in the application.

## Development

1. Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.
2. Open the project directory in your preferred code editor.
3. Make the desired changes to the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files.
4. Test the changes in a web browser to ensure they work as expected.
5. Commit and push your changes to your forked repository.
6. Create a pull request detailing the modifications you made.

## Limitations

- The user interface and design of GitSearch are basic and may not provide an optimal user experience on all devices or screen sizes.
